Project Organization
------------

├── data
│   ├── covds		<- covariance descriptors per sample
│   ├── features	<- morphological features per sample
├── docs		<- Documentation about the project
├── models		<- Trained and serialized models, model predictions, or model summaries
├── notebooks		<- jupyter notebooks used in this project
└── py			<- python scripts used in this project

To run the pipeline, make sure that the raw svs files and the polygon data are located in a directory with the same structure as the original one.
Also, make sure that the anaconda folder is located as expected in the script.intensity.sh

Then open the scripts.sh file and edit the type of cancer that you want to process. Save and exit.

Then run "bash scripts.sh"

The data folder will contain the output for both morphological features and covariance descriptors.
